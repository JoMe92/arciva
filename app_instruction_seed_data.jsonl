{"instruction": "How do I edit RAW files differently than JPEGs?", "output": "Arciva treats RAW and JPEG mostly the same in the **Quick Fix** engine (server-side rendering). However, RAW files typically offer more extensive recovery in **Highlights** and **Shadows** before degrading quality compared to JPEGs.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How do I compare the before and after state?", "output": "There isn't a dedicated 'Before/After' split view button yet. To compare, you can toggle the **Reset** button on a group (and Undo immediately) or use **Undo/Redo** (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y) to flip between your edit and the previous state.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How do I fix a dark foreground against a bright sky?", "output": "This needs shadow recovery. In **Quick Fix** > **Exposure**, increase the **Shadows** slider to brighten the foreground. You may also need to lower **Highlights** to prevent the sky from blowing out further, and perhaps tweak **Contrast** to maintain depth.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How do I create a vertical crop for social media?", "output": "In **Quick Fix** > **Crop & Align**, choose an aspect ratio like **4:5** or **9:16** (if available) or just stick to **Original** but set **Orientation** to **Vertical**. Adjust the frame to capture the subject.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How do I adjust the white balance manually?", "output": "Instead of an auto-picker, use your eyes and the **Color** sliders in **Quick Fix**. Adjust **Temperature** for Blue/Orange balance and **Tint** for Green/Magenta balance until neutral/gray tones look color-neutral.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How do I fix color noise?", "output": "Global color noise reduction isn't a specific slider in **Quick Fix**. The **Grain** tool adds texture, but to *remove* noise, typically you rely on the default processing pipeline. Adding fine grain can sometimes mask digital noise effectively.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How do I reset only the Geometry adjustments?", "output": "Navigate to the **Geometry** group in the **Quick Fix** panel and click the **Reset geometry** link/button associated with that section. This zeroes out Vertical and Horizontal skew without affecting Exposure or Color.", "language": "en"}

{"instruction": "What is a 'Date Bucket' in the Import pane?", "output": "A Date Bucket aggregates assets by Year, Month, or Day. It allows the API to return counts without fetching every single asset record.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How are raw files processed?", "output": "Raw files are decoded server-side (likely using LibRaw or similar) into a RGB buffer/preview which is sent to the browser. The browser doesn't decode RAW data directly.", "language": "en"}

{"instruction": "What happens when I rename a project?", "output": "The frontend sends a patch request with the new title. The backend updates the database record. Filenames on disk usually remain unchanged to prevent broken links.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "Can multiple users edit the same project?", "output": "Arciva generally supports concurrent access, but 'last write wins' is the typical conflict resolution strategy for metadata fields.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How are JPEGs and RAWs linked?", "output": "Linking is based on a heuristic: same directory + same basename (case-insensitive) = Pair. The system tracks this relationship in the database.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "Why is the grid gap fixed?", "output": "The grid layout uses a rigid CSS grid or absolute positioning for virtualization efficiency. Dynamic masonry layouts are harder to virtualize performantly.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is the 'cursor' in the API?", "output": "The cursor is a pagination token (often an offset or ID) used to fetch the next batch of results in an infinite scroll list.", "language": "en"}

{"instruction": "How is the 'Next Cursor' determined?", "output": "The API calculates the offset + limit. If more items exist, it returns the new offset string. If not, it returns null.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "Why can't I edit 'Date Taken'?", "output": "This is considered immutable source data. Changing it would require rewriting the original file's header, which is currently blocked for safety.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How does the frontend know about new imports?", "output": "Currently via polling or manual refresh. Real-time WebSocket updates are not standard in the basic setup yet.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is a 'Placeholder Ratio'?", "output": "It is the aspect ratio of the image, used to reserve the correct amount of vertical space in the grid before the image loads.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "Why do some images have no aspect ratio?", "output": "If the backend failed to probe the image dimensions (corrupt header), the frontend might default to a square or 3:2 placeholder.", "language": "en"}

{"instruction": "Why does the Detail view use `workerPreviewUrl`?", "output": "For Quick Fixes, a Web Worker might render the preview locally with edits applied, providing a faster real-time feedback loop than server roundtrips.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is 'Legacy Mode' in ImageHub?", "output": "If the new API endpoints 404, the client falls back to older V1 endpoints (`legacyMode = true`) to maintain compatibility with older servers.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How is the 'Filmstrip' implemented?", "output": "It's essentially a horizontal virtualized list (often same component as the grid) filtered to the current context.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "Why are metadata warnings an array?", "output": "A file can have multiple issues (e.g., 'No Exif', 'Corrupt Header', 'Missing GPS'), so the UI displays a list of strings.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is 'StackPrimaryAssetId'?", "output": "In a stack, this ID points to the 'top' image (usually the JPEG) that represents the group in the grid.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How does `useInfiniteQuery` help?", "output": "It manages the pagination state, fetching pages of assets as the user scrolls, caching them, and merging them into a single list.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is a 'ColorTag' type?", "output": "It is a TypeScript union type: `'None' | 'Red' | 'Green' | 'Blue' | 'Yellow' | 'Purple'`, enforcing strict label naming.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How are filters serialized?", "output": "The frontend converts the filter object into a JSON string or query parameters to pass complex criteria to the backend API.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is `previewOrder`?", "output": "A number used to ensure images in the Detail view appear in the correct sequence matching the grid sort order.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How does 'Auto Contrast' work (hypothetically)?", "output": "It would analyze the histogram and stretch the black/white points to 0/255. In Quick Fix, you do this manually via sliders.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What prevents memory leaks in the grid?", "output": "Browser garbage collection + virtualization. DOM nodes for off-screen images are destroyed, keeping memory usage stable.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "Why use 'normalized key' in metadata?", "output": "To handle case variations or prefix differences (e.g., 'Exif.Image.Make' vs 'Make') uniformly in the UI.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is `isStacked`?", "output": "A boolean flag indicating if the current asset record represents a collapsed group of files.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How does the sidebar 'count' update?", "output": "It relies on the project summary data fetched periodically or after actions like import/delete.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is `clampLimit`?", "output": "A utility function ensuring the requested page size is within allowed bounds (e.g., min 1, max 200) to prevent API errors.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How does the client know if `exiftool` is missing?", "output": "The backend checks the environment and sends a specific warning code/string in the metadata response object.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is the 'Rail' interaction?", "output": "Hovering the collapsed sidebar expands a mini-menu (Rail) overlay, allowing access without shifting the main layout.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How is 'Crop Orientation' defined?", "output": "It determines if the aspect ratio is applied in Portrait or Landscape mode relative to the original image.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What does `sanitizeNumber` do in Quick Fix?", "output": "It ensures that values from the API or inputs are valid finite numbers, falling back to defaults if they are NaN or invalid strings.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "Why is the API base URL dynamic?", "output": "`withBase` helper allows the app to be served from a subdirectory or different domain (CORS) without hardcoding paths.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What does 'Review Mode' imply?", "output": "Typically implies a simplified interface for Rating/Culling, though Arciva integrates this into the main Grid/Detail views.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How are assets deduplicated in the list?", "output": "React keys (asset ID) ensure unikeness. If the API returns duplicates, the frontend logic might filter them or they cause React warnings.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is `quickFixStateToPayload`?", "output": "A function that strips default values from the state before sending to the server, optimizing bandwidth by sending only 'diffs'.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "Why separate `exposure` and `contrast` into a group?", "output": "Logical grouping (Exposure Group) helps UI organization. They are often processed in the same color pipeline stage.", "language": "en"}

{"instruction": "How does `virtual list` scrolling work?", "output": "It calculates the total height based on item count * row height, creates a spacer div, and positions only the visible subset of rows absolute.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is 'Layout Thrashing'?", "output": "Rapid reading/writing of DOM dimensions causing reflows. Arciva avoids this by using fixed sizing or batching updates where possible.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How does the 'Pick' shortcut toggle?", "output": "The handler checks `current.picked`. If true, calls update(false). If false, calls update(true).", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "Why use 'Double Click' on grid?", "output": "Standard UX pattern for 'Open'. Single click selects, double click activates (enters Detail view).", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is `hasEdits` derived from?", "output": "Backend check: does the asset have any non-default Quick Fix parameters or cropped status?", "language": "en"}

{"instruction": "What is 'Optimistic UI'?", "output": "Updating the UI instantly (e.g. showing a star rating) before the server confirms the save, making the app feel faster.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "How does 'Select All' handle huge lists?", "output": "It likely selects all *IDs* internally or sets a 'SelectAllMode' flag, as selecting 10k objects in RAM is inefficient.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "What is `LayoutListIcon`?", "output": "An icon component (likely Lucide or Heroicons) representing the Overview/List functionality in the sidebar.", "language": "en"}
{"instruction": "Why are dependencies injected?", "output": "To allow easy mocking of API calls or services during unit testing.", "language": "en"}
