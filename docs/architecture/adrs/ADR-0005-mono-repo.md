# ADR-0005 — Mono-Repo Structure (frontend + backend + infra + docs)

**Context**: Single developer, tight iteration, shared env/config.

**Decision**: Keep frontend and backend in one repository with clear top-level folders.

**Alternatives**: Split repos (clean separation, more overhead).

**Consequences**: Easier local dev and CI; later split remains possible.
